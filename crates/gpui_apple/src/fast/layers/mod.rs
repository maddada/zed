//! Scroll layer tiles on Metal: the textures a layer's content is rasterized
//! into, and the passes that draw them where the scene composites them.
//! The core side is `gpui::fast::layers`; see
//! docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-scroll-layers-design.md, §5. The wgpu
//! renderer's counterpart is `gpui_wgpu`'s `fast::layers`.
