//! A frame whose path batches are rasterized in groups, with fewer render
//! command encoders.
//!
//! Upstream's `draw_primitives_to_texture` gives every path batch two render
//! command encoders of its own: it ends the main encoder, rasterizes the
//! batch's paths into the cleared intermediate texture in a new encoder, and
//! begins a new main encoder to composite them. A frame with six path batches
//! (six sparklines) thus encodes thirteen render passes. Every encoder costs
//! the CPU a render pass descriptor, an encoder and its viewport, and on Apple
//! GPUs, which render in tiles, every restarted main pass stores the whole
//! drawable to memory and loads it back.
//!
//! Here, as in `gpui_wgpu`'s `fast::frame`, consecutive path batches that don't
//! come near each other share one rasterization pass, and the first group's
//! pass runs before the main pass begins, so a frame whose path batches don't
//! overlap is encoded in two passes. The vertices of every path in the frame
//! are written to the instance buffer once, and each group draws its range of
//! them. Each batch's pixels in the intermediate texture are then the same as
//! if it had been rasterized alone into the cleared texture, so the image is
//! the same as upstream's.
