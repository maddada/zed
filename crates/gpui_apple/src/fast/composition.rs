//! Renderers for the extra GPUI surfaces of a composed window.
//!
//! Ported from zed-industries/zed#62379. A window that composes native views
//! between GPUI's base content and its overlays draws each GPUI surface on a
//! `CAMetalLayer` of its own. Every surface's renderer shares the window
//! renderer's device and sprite atlas, so glyphs and images rasterized for
//! one surface are there for the others, and the tiles a frame's scene refers
//! to are valid whichever surface draws them.
