//! Everything gpui-fast adds to GPUI lives under this module.
//!
//! The rest of this crate is kept as close to upstream GPUI (Zed's
//! `crates/gpui`) as possible, so that pulling in upstream changes stays a
//! matter of merging rather than of rewriting. Upstream files only *call into*
//! this module: a field holding this module's state, a line forwarding a method
//! to it, a hook at the point something happens. The logic itself — data
//! structures, algorithms, bookkeeping, tests — is written here, one file per
//! topic. See `docs/upstream-sync.md` for the rules and how they are checked.
//!
//! Nothing here is glob-imported or glob-re-exported. Code, upstream's or
//! ours, names what it uses by its place in this module —
//! `crate::fast::retained::RetainedSubtrees` — so it is always plain where it
//! comes from. The few items that are public API are exported from the crate
//! root one by one, in `gpui.rs`.
