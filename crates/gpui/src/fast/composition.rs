//! Window composition: native views between GPUI's content and its overlays.
//!
//! Ported from zed-industries/zed#62379. A window paints one scene, as
//! always, but can present it on several ordered surfaces, so that a
//! platform-native view (a `WKWebView`, a WebView2, a Wayland subsurface fed
//! by another GPU producer) sits above GPUI's base content and below its
//! overlays — popovers, dialogs, menus, tooltips:
//!
//! ```text
//! front  GPUI overlay   deferred and window-level draws
//!        native surface  WKWebView / WebView2 / wl_subsurface / X11 child
//! back   GPUI base       the root view
//! ```
//!
//! [`CompositionTree`] holds each surface's identity, parent and sibling
//! order. The frame records, as it paints, which GPUI surface each stretch
//! of the scene targets ([`SurfaceStarts`]); presenting splits the scene
//! along those stretches into a [`ComposedScene`], and the platform draws
//! each surface's part onto its own layer, visual or subsurface.
//!
//! Composition is opt-in: until [`Window::enable_window_composition`] is
//! called, a window presents its scene with `PlatformWindow::draw`, as
//! upstream does.
//!
//! Unlike the upstream pull request, a view drawn again from last frame
//! (every retained view, here) carries the surface switches it made with it:
//! [`reuse_starts`] copies them along with its scene.
