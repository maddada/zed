//! [`paint_children`]. They ask [`policy::decide`] what to do and do it:

//! - `Bypass`: today's path.
//! - `Repaint`: the children are prepainted and painted as today, in window

//!   viewport and its overscan) instead of the viewport, and painted into the
//!   layer's own scene, which is then stored in content space, diffed into
//!   tiles, and composited.
//! - `Composite`: the children are neither prepainted nor painted; the layer's
//!   tiles are composited at the new offset.
