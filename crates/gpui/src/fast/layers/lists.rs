//! Rendering only the rows of a `uniform_list` or `list` its layer lacks (M6).
//!
//! A virtual list renders only the rows it shows. Its layer holds more: the
//! rows its viewport shows and two viewports' worth of rows on each side
//! (the overscan), each painted into the layer at its place in content
//! space and kept there by row. On a frame that only scrolled the list the
//! rows the layer holds are neither rendered, laid out, prepainted nor
//! painted: only the rows the scroll brought into the overscan are, and
//! those whose hover changed, and are added to the layer, whose tiles over
//! them become dirty (spec §8). Any other frame paints the rows afresh, as
//! a div's layer is.
//!
//! Each row the layer holds keeps what it handed the frame besides what it
//! drew: where its prepaint and paint records (hitboxes, listeners, element
//! states, dispatch nodes) lie in the frame last drawn, its hitboxes as
//! painted and the hovers it was painted by. A frame that keeps the row
//! carries those records into itself, its hitboxes moved by the scroll
//! since the row was painted, as [`crate::fast::layers::reuse`] carries a
//! div's content; a row whose hovers changed is rendered again, alone.
//!
//! The layer's content is one part per row (see
//! [`crate::fast::layers::scene::LayerContent`]), in the order of the rows,
//! and each row's tiles are hashed once, when it is painted: a frame adding
//! or changing rows hands the renderer the other rows as they were and
//! combines the hashes of the tiles they reach. Rows that left the overscan
//! are dropped a batch at a time (see [`retained_rows`]).
//!
//! The list elements call in here from a few hooks:
//!
//! - `uniform_list`: [`measure_item`], [`snap_item_offset`],
//!   [`begin_uniform_list`], [`render_rows`], [`row_indices`],
//!   [`prepaint_row`] and [`end_rows`] where it prepaints its rows;
//!   [`begin_paint_rows`], [`paint_row`] and [`end_paint_rows`] where it
//!   paints them.
//! - `list`: [`begin_list`], [`keeps_row`], [`snap_item_origin`],
//!   [`place_list_item`] and [`end_list`] where it lays out and prepaints
//!   its rows; [`begin_paint_list`], [`paint_row`] and [`end_paint_list`]
//!   where it paints them. A `list` has no element id: its layer is known by
//!   the id of the elements around it and its state.
//!
//! Between a list's prepaint and its paint, what the frame does with its
//! rows lives in its layer's [`LayerRows`]. While its rows prepaint and
//! paint, `WindowLayers::painting` is set, as for a div's layer, so that
//! nested views and scroll containers are painted into the layer.
