//! Which scroll containers get a layer: eligibility, promotion, demotion
//! and drop (M4).
//!
//! A scroll container is looked at every frame it prepaints its children.
//! It gets a layer once it has scrolled on two frames in a row (a container
//! that never scrolls never pays for one); from then on the layer is
//! composited on frames that only scrolled it and painted again on the
//! others. A layer is demoted — dropped, the container kept on today's path
//! until its content has been stable for a while — when its content keeps
//! changing, when it paints paths, or when its visible tiles alone exceed
//! the budget. Content holding what a layer cannot composite otherwise
//! (spec §6.5) keeps the container on today's path only while it does: the
//! layer is dropped and painted again a few frames later, to see whether it
//! still does. Layers are dropped when the window is resized or rescaled,
//! and when they have not been composited for long.
