//! Tessellated paths kept from one build to the next.
//!
//! A path is tessellated into triangles every time it is built, which for a
//! sparkline in every row of a table, a chart's moving averages or a donut is
//! a large part of what painting them costs, though most of them are the same
//! shape as the frame before, or the same shape moved, as a table scrolls.
//!
//! [`build`] tessellates a path relative to its first point and keeps the
//! triangles, keyed by that relative path and by how it is stroked or filled;
//! a path of the same shape built again anywhere reuses them, moved to its
//! first point. Every path is tessellated that way, kept or not, so a path
//! drawn from kept triangles is exactly the path tessellating it again gives.
