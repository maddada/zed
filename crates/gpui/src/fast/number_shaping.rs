//! Numbers shaped from their glyphs, without asking the platform each time.
//!
//! A table of prices or a ticker shows new numbers every frame, and each one
//! is a line the platform has never shaped: on macOS, a new CoreText line per
//! number. But a number in one font and size is its digits set side by side:
//! each digit's glyph and advance, adjusted by the kerning between each pair
//! of neighbours. [`NumberShaping`] measures those once per font and size, by
//! having the platform shape each character and each pair of characters on
//! their own, and puts numbers together from them.
//!
//! That holds only while nothing but pairs of neighbours affects the result:
//! no ligatures, no substitutions depending on a wider context. The
//! characters taken are therefore few — digits, the signs and separators
//! numbers are written with, and the letters of compact units — and a pair
//! the platform shapes as anything other than the two glyphs moved apart is
//! never put together here. What remains is checked: the first lines put
//! together in each font and size, and one in every few hundred after that,
//! are shaped by the platform as well, and a font and size where the two
//! differ is left to the platform from then on.
