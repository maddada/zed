//! Drawing a view again from last frame around the views nested in it that
//! have to be built again.
//!
//! Notifying a view marks every view around it dirty, because they have to be
//! walked to reach it. Upstream builds them all again; a retained view that is
//! dirty only because something nested in it is — it was not notified, and
//! nothing it read itself changed — is instead drawn again from last frame,
//! stretch by stretch, with the nested views that changed built again in the
//! gaps where they were drawn:
//!
//! - its layout is last frame's, and each nested view that changed is laid
//!   out again at its own nodes. If one of them asks for another layout — a
//!   node created, a style or a child list rewritten, a measurement that no
//!   longer stands — the view around it is built after all, as before;
//! - its prepaint and paint are copied from last frame up to where each
//!   nested view began, the nested view is prepainted and painted where it
//!   was, with what it inherited there, and the copy goes on after it.
//!
//! A nested view can be built on its own only if it can be rendered without
//! the view around it: [`RebuildHandle`] holds it as an [`AnyView`] when it
//! was placed as an entity or an `AnyView`, and [`Rebuild`] what it inherited.
