//! Rasterizing a scroll layer tile: the layer's content over the tile,
//! translated into the tile's space, drawn into the tile's texture cleared
//! to the layer's baked background, with the frame's pipelines and a
//! viewport the size of the tile.
//!
//! All position-dependent shading is relative to each primitive's own bounds,
//! and the tile is a whole number of device pixels from the content's
//! origin, so a tile holds exactly the pixels the content would have drawn
//! over the same background in the window.
