//! Render pass state set only when it changes.
//!
//! Upstream sets the pipeline and every bind group before each batch's draw.
//! wgpu-core doesn't skip a repeated `set_pipeline`: it records it, validates
//! it, re-derives the bind group state and emits it to the driver again, and
//! the same for each `set_bind_group`. Consecutive batches share the globals
//! bind group always, and often the pipeline, the instance bind group and the
//! atlas texture, so most of those calls were no-ops that still cost CPU.
//!
//! Bind groups stay bound across `set_pipeline` in WebGPU, so skipping a call
//! whose bind group is already bound draws the same image.
